        "description": "After analyzing and comparing multiple methods for forecasting, planning, MRP, Capacity, and simulation/scheduling, we identified a few notable findings. Preferred forecasting models are reported to Vikings division so that in the future, the same methods can be used to forecast demand since the MAD of all methods used are <10 which abides by the standards. Forecasting models suggested are exponential smoothing with trend adjustment for products 1, 4, and 5, seasonal forecast without trend for product-2 and seasonal forecast with trend for product-3. Vikings division should adopt formal production planning policies that reduce overall cost, inventory and backorders. Based on our analysis, we recommend that level policy be used for products 2,3 and 4, and chase policy for products 1 and 5. MRP allows for gathering information regarding the amount of material needed to perform the operations of the company which helps specify amounts of stock needed to meet the parameters stated. Capacity planning analysis gives an overall idea of the amount of stations and subproducts that is possible to manufacture along with providing values of how long the setup and processing time regarding each station will require which gives an overall layout of the products that can be produced. Lastly, the simulation/scheduling helped resolve the layout of how the allocation of the capacity will be handled as it provides information of how queue times are handled along with how the subproducts and going through the stations and which can provide variables of factors such as repair and downtime needed to sustain the workplace",

The purpose of this project is to predict price of houses in California based on a number of location-based predictors. The motivation behind selecting this dataset is to understand how the prices of houses move and what factor contribute to high or low price for houses. In todayâ€™s technologically advanced world, there are many ways in which real estate agents and policy makers can benefit from this housing price analysis. If I were a real estate agent, Predictive analysis of housing prices would help me conduct business in less time with more accuracy(Machin, 2019). Alternatively, policy makers and economists can understand the trend in housing prices and itâ€™ll help them in the decision making process.",

        "description": "This project is solving the problem of wasted energy within buildings and homes, because currently the lights turned on inside buildings do not utilize natural, ambient light from the sun. Rather than having unnecessary light from a light source, the automated light sensing smart blinds can sense the amount of light outside the window and in the room, and then adjust the angle of the blinds to save energy by utilizing the available outdoor light. This way, the light source will not be running at maximum power output while there is excess light coming through the window. This project aims to design and construct the light sensing blinds to achieve the aforementioned goals. Hardware test results from this project demonstrate the capabilities of the smart blind system to measure ambient light outside the window, to adjust the angle of each of the blinds on the window, and to change the desired brightness of the room.

        "description": "The functionality and sensitivity of an IR sensor were explored in this experiment. The use of datasheets and circuit design were utilized and improved in the process of designing a personalized tachometer. A deeper understanding in the application of DAQ and LabVIEW software was acquired. One lesson learned was the difference in ability between my DAQ and BNC2120 DAQ. It was discovered that my DAQ does not have a counter, and therefore required more advanced LabVIEW programming to output a rotational speed reading. The BNC2120 DAQ counter function was explored in this experiment and made the frequency to rotational speed conversion relatively simple. Another lesson learned was to continually measure the interrupters voltage signal output with a DMM to ensure the collector and emitter was not damaged with the variation of voltage. It is highly recommended to reference the datasheet for your specific IR sensor and an addition of pulldown resistors to each node except the ground when wiring the interrupter. It is common to burn out the emitter diodes, even with voltages within the datasheet specifications. Due to this possibility, consistently checking that the IR sensor is functioning properly using a DMM can save a lot of time. Secondly, to improve the accuracy of frequency readings, it is recommended to provide a shield around the IR sensor to reduce ambient light noise. The more consistency introduced into the experiment, the higher the likelihood of accurate results.",
